# Space Egg ‚Äì Illuminated DIY Soldering Kit

The **Space Egg** is a fun and beginner-friendly **soldering kit** combined with **3D-printed components**. It features an interactive mechanism where turning the egg aligns a **magnetic switch (reed switch)** with a **magnet**, powering on the three **RGB LEDs**. This creates a stunning light effect inside the egg and the flame underneath the rocket-shaped egg cup.

This fantastic kit was created in collaboration with **Olaf Emcke**.
